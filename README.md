# YouTube-Converter
Python program that takes a YouTube link as input, and returns either an MP3 or MP4 file.

# How it Works
The project is as simple as it sounds lol. Now, you can avoid all those fishy sites that probably have malware/spyware/adware and just convert YouTube videos yourself.

The program will ask for a YouTube link (yes, you can just copy and paste), and then whether or not you want the output to be MP3 or MP4 (audio vs video).
